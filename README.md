We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-snapshot/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Basic Function
```hcl
module "snapshot" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-snapshot.git?ref=tags/0.12.0"
  create_name                 = "snapshot-create"
  create_application          = "clouddrove"
  create_environment          = "test"
  delete_name                 = "snapshot-delete"
  delete_application          = "clouddrove"
  delete_environment          = "test"
  label_order                 = ["environment", "name", "application"]
  enabled                     = true
  region                      = "eu-west-1"
  account_id                  = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  create_schedule_expression  = "cron(0 2 * * ? *)"
  delete_schedule_expression  = "cron(0 1 * * ? *)"
  variables                   = {"webhook_url"="https://hooks.slack.com/services/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"}
}
```
